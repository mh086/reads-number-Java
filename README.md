# reads-number-Java
Write a program that reads number between 1,000 and 999,999 (with comma) from the 
user and prints it without a comma separating the thousands.  Read the input as string.  Find the 
length of the string and use the substring to break it into two pieces.  Do not include the comma.  
You can then concatenate using the + symbol to reassemble without the comma.  For example if the 
number is 123,456.  First would equal 123 and second would equal 456.  noCommaNumber would 
be 123456.


The original U.S. income tax of 1913 was quite simple. The tax was
 1 percent on the first $50,000.
 2 percent on the amount over $50,000 up to $75,000.
 3 percent on the amount over $75,000 up to $100,000.
 4 percent on the amount over $100,000 up to $250,000.
 5 percent on the amount over $250,000 up to $500,000.
 6 percent on the amount over $500,000.
Note that the tax rate is different for different intervals of the income. The tax rate is 1% on the first 
$50,000; 2% for the amount of (income-$50,000) if $50,000<income<$75,000; 2% for the amount of 
($75,000-$50,000) and 3% for the amount of (income-$75,000) if $75,000<income<$100,000, ....   
There was no separate schedule for single or married taxpayers. Write a program that prompts a 
user to provide income and then prints the tax.
